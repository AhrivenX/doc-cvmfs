\abstract{
	The \cernvmfs\ is a client-server file system developed to deliver software stacks onto virtual machines in a fast, scalable, and reliable way.
	\cvmfs\ is implemented as a FUSE module.
	It makes a specially prepared directory tree stored on a web server look like a local read-only file system on the virtual machine. 
	\cvmfs\ uses outgoing HTTP connections only, thereby it avoids most of the firewall issues of other network file systems.
	It transfers data file by file on demand, verifying the content by SHA-1 keys.
	
	By means of aggressive caching and reduction of latency, we focus specifically for the software use case.
	Volumes hosting software consist usually of many small files that are frequently opened and read as a whole.
	Furthermore, we see frequent looking for files in multiple directories when search paths are examined.
	
	We currently use \cvmfs\ as part of the \cernvm\ project.
	ATLAS and LHCb experiments use it to distribute software and conditions data to Grid sites.
	We host and distribute several hundred gigabytes of software, amongst others experiment software for ATLAS, CMS, LHCb, NA61 as well as software for the LCD collaboration.
