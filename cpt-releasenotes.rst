Release Notes for CernVM-FS 2.6.0
=================================

Together with CernVM-FS 2.6.0, we also release the CernVM-FS Repository Gateway
version 1.0. The increased version number indicates that we are ready to assure backward compatibility for the component, in line with `semantic versioning <https://semver.org/>`_ rules.

In addition to various bugfixes, this version introduces an improved repository
configuration format, which should greatly simplify the initial setup of the
repository gateway in a large number of cases. Please consult the updated
repository gateway documentation: :ref:`cpt_repository_gateway`.

This release also includes an experimental preview of the new notification
system. Please consult the relevant documentation page for more details:
:ref:`cpt_notification_system`.
