\chapter{\cvmfs\ Server Infrastructure}
\label{apx:serverinfrastructure}

This is trying to be a full documentation of a \cvmfs\ server setup including the infrastructure necessary for an individual repository.
It is highly recommended to first consult Section~\ref{sct:repoanatomy} for a more general overview of the involved directory structure.

\section{Prerequisites}
A \cvmfs\ server installation depends on some environment setup and tools to be in place:
\begin{itemize}
\item \aufs\ support in the kernel (see Section~\ref{sct:customkernelinstall})
\item Backend storage location available through HTTP
\item \textbf{cvmfs} and \textbf{cvmfs-server} packages installed
\end{itemize}
